# Tajine with Chicken

Tajine is a Maghrebi dish named after the clay vessel used to cook the dish. However, you don't need to have a tajine in order to make tajine. You can simply use a pot and still get good results. For the harissa spice blend, you can omit many of the ingredients. The rest are listed for completeness.
