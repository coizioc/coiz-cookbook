# Pastéis de Nata

Pastéis (sing. pastel) de nata were first developed in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1700's by monks at the Jerónimos Monastery. I first discovered this custard tart during my trip to Portugal, where it quickly became a daily treat and is now my favorite pastry in the world. If you are ever in Lisbon, I recommend you get some at the Pastéis de Belem, just down the street from the Jerónimos Monastery. But really, most any cafe there will have them. While I managed to find some elsewhere in Europe, and even some in a few Asian countries, nothing has yet matched my experience in Portugal. While the process to make them is fairy laborious, especially at home, I find the effort well worth it, and I hope you will too.

This recipe is adapted from [a recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=099qXDYutyg) by Chef John of Wood Wishes and makes 12 tarts.

## Ingredients

- Dough:
  - 1 cup AP flour
  - 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
  - 1/3 cup cold water
  - 1 stick of butter, very soft.
- Syrup:
  - 3/4 cup white sugar
  - 1/4 cup + 1 tbsn water
  - 1 tsp cinnamon
  - Zest from one lemon (optional)
- Custard Base:
  - 1/3 cup AP flour
  - 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
  - 3/2 cup milk
  - 6 egg yolks
  - 1 tspn vanilla extract

## Steps

1. Mix flour, salt, and water into a dough. Transfer onto floured surface and let rest covered for 15-20 minutes.
2. Roll dough into square about 1/8 of an inch thick. Spead 1/3 of the butter onto 2/3rds of the square and fold into thirds. Repeat this step and put the dough into the fridge for 10 minutes.
3. Finally, roll the dough into a square again about an 1/8 of an inch thick. Spread the remaining butter to cover the entire surface of the dough, except an inch on one side, and roll into a log. Wrap in plastic wrap and let chill overnight.
4. To make the syrup, add sugar, water, cinnamon, and lemon zest to a pot and heat it to 100C. Turn off the heat and put aside.
5. To make the custard base, combine flour, salt, and milk in another pot and whisk until combined. Put over medium heat until thickened. Take off the heat and let cool for 10 minutes.
6. Add the egg yolks to the custard base and whisk to combine. Add the syrup and vanilla extract and whisk to combine. Strain the finished custard into a pouring cup and put aside.
7. Preheat your oven to 550F. Take out the chilled dough log and cut off the tapered ends. Cut the remaining dough into 12 even pieces.
8. Take a piece and push down into a muffin pan, swirl-side up. Push up the sides of the dough until it covers the surface of the tin. Fill up any holes with the ends of the dough log.
9. Fill each tin with the custard until it fills about 80% of the dough. Bake for 12-14 minutes.
10. Remove tarts from pan and let cool until eating tempurature. Optionally top with cinnamon and/or powdered sugar.
