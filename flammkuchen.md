##Flammkuchen

Flammkuchen, lso called Alsatian tart, tarte flamb√©e, or Flammekueche, is a German dish similar to a pizza. I call it Flammkuchen because that is the name I am most familiar with, being the one I'd see at the German Christmas markets I would go to with my mom.  

This recipe is based on [a recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=435&v=MRGMRtmMSEQ) by Chef John of Food Wishes and makes 1.
