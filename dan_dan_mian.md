This recipe is based off of [a recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BXJcCLCugo) by Chinese Cooking Demystified and makes enough for one person.

## Ingredients

- 0.2 lb pork, diced, marinated for 15 mins with
  - 1/4 tsp salt
  - 1/4 tsp white pepper
  - 1/2 tsp sugar
  - 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
  - 1/2 tbsp liaojiu
  - 1/2 tbsp rice wine vinegar
  - 1/2 tsp sesame oil
- Yacai, (or sub with one handful of spinach, roughly chopped)
- One scallion, sliced, separated into white and green parts
- One clove of garlic
- Dan dan sauce:
  - 1 tbsp sesame paste
  - 1 tbsp soy sauce
  - 1 tsp Sichuan peppercorns, crushed
  - 2 tsp chili oil, plus additional to taste.
  - 1 tbsp sugar
  - 1 tsp MSG
- 1 bundle soumen noodles
- About 10-20 peanuts, roasted on medium until slighly blackened.
- Peanut oil

## Steps

1. Boil salted water on a stove. On another burner, heat a pan up on medium-high heat. Pour in some peanut oil, and put meat with marinade, yacai, garlic, and sliced white part of scallions in and let fry for a couple minutes. Pour over some liaojiu and soy sauce. Let fry for another minute, and take off the heat.
2. Put noodles in boiling water until cooked, about 3 minutes. While waiting, spread the dan dan sauce onto a plate. It should have a paste-like consistancy.
3. When the noodles are done cooking, run under cold water to stop cooking, and place over the dan dan sauce. Top with the meat mixture, peanuts, green part of scallions, and chili oil.
