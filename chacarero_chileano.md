# Chacarero Chileano

A chacarero is a meat sandwich originating from Chile. I was personally introduced to this dish in Germany with my mom, where there is a Chilean restaurant about ten minutes from her house who specializes in making this sandwich. We would often get this with [sopaipillas](sopaipillas.md) and french fries. I can't speak to how authentic the version we had in Germany or the one presented here is, but either way it makes for a very tasty sandwich.

This recipe is based off of [a recipe](https://www.midiariodecocina.com/en/chacarero-chilean-sandwich/) from Mi Diario de Cocina and makes 4 sandwiches.

## Ingredients

- 1 bag (12 oz) green beans
- 1 flank or sirloin steak (about 1 lb and 1 in thick)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Oil for frying
- 4 [sandwich rolls](sandwich_rolls.md)
- 2 large tomatoes, diced
- 2 cloves garlic
- Mayonnaise (optional)
- Cheese (optional)
- Sliced hot peppers (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Steps

1. Crush 2 cloves of garlic and mix with oil and salt and pepper in bag. place meat in bag and marinate for at least an hour.
2. Boil some water, and add salt and green beans. Cook for 5 mins and transfer to ice bath.
3. Cook steak on high heat for about 4 mins on each side or until cooked medium-rare. Let rest for 5 mins then slice thinly against the grain.
4. To assemble the sandwich, cut sandwich roll in half and place meat, tomatoes, and then green beans. Optionally spread mayo on the buns or top with cheese and/or sliced peppers.
