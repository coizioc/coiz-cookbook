# Sopaipillas

Sopaipillas are a fried pastry found all over Latin America. This version is based off of the Chilean variety, which uses crushed pumpkin as the base for its dough.

This recipe was adopted from my mom's experiments in recreating this dish from the Chilean restaurant by her house, and makes about 12.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup crushed pumpkin (about half a can's worth)
- 2 cup flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 3 tbsp oil/butter
- Oil for frying

For the dipping sauce (pebre/salsa andrea):

- 1/2 cup packed parsley, chopped
- 1 medium 2 inch chili peppers, sliced
- 1/2 small red onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- Salt and pepper
- Garlic powder
- Onion powder
- Oil
- Apple cider vinegar (optional)
- Lime juice

## Steps

1. Mix dry pumpkin, flour, baking powder, salt, and oil until smooth and pliable. Let stand for 20 mins.
2. On floured surface, roll out and split the dough into flattened circles. Poke holes on top of each one with a fork.
3. Fry in oil (180C/350F) for 1 minute on each side until golden brown.
