# Kvas

Kvas is a fermented "soft drink" that is popular in Eastern Europe. The recipe sounds very suspect when you describe it, but the end result tastes like a sweetened, fruity beer.

This recipe is based off of [a recipe](https://natashaskitchen.com/angelinas-easy-bread-kvas-recipe/) from Natasha's Kitchen and makes enough to fill a 2-liter soda bottle.

## Ingredients

- 3 slices rye bread
- 1 box (1 oz) raisins
- 6 cups water
- 1/2 tbsp yeast
- 4/3 cup sugar

## Steps

1. Toast rye bread until burnt and black.
2. Add bread, raisins, and water to pot and boil. Turn off heat once it reaches a boil and let sit overnight or about 8 hours.
3. Remove the bread and add yeast and sugar to the remaining liquid. Let sit another 8 hours.
4. Remove solids and bottle the remaining liquid. Use a paper towel wrapped on tight with rubber bands to prevent the pressure from building up too much inside the bottle.
5. Let sit overnight or a few days before drinking.
