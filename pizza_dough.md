# Pizza Dough

This recipe is adapted from [a recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz8HlqYn98Q) by Chef John of Food Wishes and makes 4 personal-sized pizzas.

## Ingredients

- 1 package (2 1/4 tsp) yeast
- 1 tsp honey (sub. 1 tsp sugar)
- 1 cup warm water (105F)
- 3 cups AP flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp olive oil

## Steps

1. Mix yeast with honey and water and let activate for 10 minutes.
2. Add in salt, olive oil, and 1 cup of flour. Mix until combined into batter. Add in another cup of flour and mix until combined into a shaggy dough.
3. Put dough onto floured surface and knead for at least 10 minutes, adding flour as needed, until you can stretch the dough thin enough to see light through it.
4. Split dough into 4 pieces and put each piece into an oil-lined container and let rise for 2 hours at room temperature or at least 24 hours in the fridge.
