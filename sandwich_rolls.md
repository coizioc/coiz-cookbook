# Sandwich Rolls (Pan para Sandwich)

While I originally used this recipe to create the sandwich rolls for the [chacarero chileano](chacarero_chileano.md), these will work with a variety of fillings.

This recipe is based off [a recipe](https://www.midiariodecocina.com/en/sandwich-bread/) from Mi Diario de Cocina and makes 6 rolls.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup warm water (40-46C)
- 1 packet (2 1/4 tsp) yeast
- 1 cup warm milk (40-46C)
- 2 tbsp melted butter
- 2 tbsp granulated sugar
- 3/2 tsp salt
- 5.5-6 cups flour
- 1 egg yolk + 1 tsp water

## Steps

1. Combine 1/2 cup warm water with yeast and pinch of sugar. Stir and let stand for 10 mins.
2. Place rest of water, milk, butter, sugar, and salt in large bowl. Add yeast mixture and combine. Then add 2 cups of flour and mix.
3. Stir until flour is well incorporated, then slowly add the rest of the flour.
4. When dough no longer sticks in the bowl, keep kneeding a couple mins.
5. Place the dough in another bowl greased with oil, and cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 1 hour or until it doubles in size.
6. Take out the dough and split into 6 pieces. Place bread in baking tray covered with butter paper. Let the bread rest.
7. Preheat oven to 400F (200C). Before placing in oven, brush each bread with the yolk mixture.
8. Bake for 15-20 mins.
